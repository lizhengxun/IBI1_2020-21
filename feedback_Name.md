Improvements I made responding to the Formative Feedback:
1. In Practical 4, the content of file index.md was same as rob's and I have changed it now.
2. In Practical 5/mystery_code.py, my answer was not completely correct and I haved made my answer more concise now.
3. In Practical 6/Coronavirus rates, I forgot to output the frequency table and I have changed my code to make the table print. Besides, I forgot the title of pie chart and the title have been filled in.
4. In Practical 6, I have added the pseudocode to make my codes easier to be understood.
5. In Practical 6/List manipulation, I did not sort list of average exon length numerically and now I have added a sorted function to sort the list.
