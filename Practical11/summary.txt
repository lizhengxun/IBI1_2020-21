Result:
1. The alignment score between human and mouse is 1091 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 89.64%.
2. The alignment score between mouse and random sequecnce is -250 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 5.86%. 
3. The alignment score between human and random sequecnce is -250 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 5.41%.
Analysis:
Campared with the score of human-random and mouse-random groups, the high socre and percentage of SOD2 protein indicated the high similarity of this protein between human and mouse.
Also, this result may indicate that the gene for the SOD2 are conserved across species and this protein may play a role in some basic celluar metabolic activities.
