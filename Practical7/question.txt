 peaking on February 13. Then it decreased gradually. It suggests that china 
made every effort to fight against covid 19. The number of new cases per day 
in United Kingdom it was close to zero at first, and then the growth rate
picked up gradually. It suggested that the UK was initially unaffected
by COVID-19, but the virus spread in UK in the end. This result also shows
